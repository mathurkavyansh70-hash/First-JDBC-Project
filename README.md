# First-JDBC-Project
i have created a console based "Student Management System" only using some basic methods and a approach of menu driven program for every query available in SQL using JAVA and JDBC and here i have used Postgresql to manage the database.
This is a console-based CRUD application built using Java and JDBC to manage student records in PostgreSQL. PreparedStatements are used to prevent SQL injection and basic menu options allow add, view, update, delete operations.
# Features
✔ Add new student
✔ View student by ID
✔ View all students
✔ Update student details
✔ Delete student record
✔ PostgreSQL integration
✔ PreparedStatement for security

## Database Configuration
This project uses PostgreSQL.

Before running the project, update the following values in the source code:

String url = "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database_name";
String username = "postgres";
String password = "your_password"; 

## Create the table using the following SQL:
CREATE TABLE studentdata (
    sid INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    sname TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age INTEGER,
    course TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
# Note:
- sid is auto-generated by PostgreSQL.
- Database name, credentials, and table name may differ across systems.
- Update JDBC connection URL, username, and password accordingly.
