# First-JDBC-Project
i have created a console based "Student Management System" only using some basic methods and a approach of menu driven program for every query available in SQL using JAVA and JDBC and here i have used Postgresql to manage the database.
This is a console-based CRUD application built using Java and JDBC to manage student records in PostgreSQL. PreparedStatements are used to prevent SQL injection and basic menu options allow add, view, update, delete operations.
